## Installation instructions:

### Mac OS:

First, you will have to install all the dependent c library using `brew` whose installation link
is [here](https://brew.sh/). `brew install boost --with-python` will provide with the installation of boost with python integration along with all the co-dependencies for that library itself. You will also need to get: `brew install cmake wget sdl2`. The installations will take time, even if there is no problem.

Next, one needs to install the vizdoom library with `pip install vizdoom`. One will also need to install the python libraries not present in the environment using the command `pip install <library>`.
